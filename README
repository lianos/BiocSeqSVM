This package serves as a quick introduction to the application of some
machine learning concepts to next generation sequencing data, which you will
find outlined in the MLplay vignette.

                  THE MLplay VIGNETTE IS CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE

                      Editing up through to the end of the 
              "Kernels (and the dual of the SVM)" section is almost
                 complete, so you can work you way through that.

I initially put this together for one of the tutorials to be presented at
the Advanced R/Bioconductor Workshop on High-Throughput Genetic Analysis,
2012:
